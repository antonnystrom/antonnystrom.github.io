     <h2 class="project-heading-h2">Background</h2>   
        <p id="p-project-text-left">In order to showcase some of my previous work and to provide information about myself, I developed this portfolio website you’re on right now. It’s a basic website but I built it myself from the ground up, using HTML, CSS (and a little bit of Javascript), and I had fun doing it! Below I give some short info about the process, the tools I used, and a few of the design decisions made, because as always, there’s more to this website than meets the eye.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="project-heading-h2">The Basics</h2>   
          <div class="about-me">
    
        <div class="project-content-area">
        
        
           <div class="text-block" id="about-text">
            
            <h3 class="project-heading-h3">Prototyping in Sketch</h3>
                
            <p id="p-project-text-left-margin">Before actually developing the website, I made a few design sketches in Sketch. Trying out different grids, ways of presenting information and playing around with the color scheme of the website. I found this to be a good way to go before writing any code. Luckily I have some experience in front-end development, so when playing around with different designs in Sketch could disregard or modify different solutions based on difficult they would be for me to actually implement. I landed with a basic design that would scale well for both small and big screens.</p>

             <h3 class="project-heading-h3">HTML/CSS</h3>
                
            <p id="p-project-text-left">I wanted to build this site all by myself, so I didn’t use any templates or anything to start out. This also allowed me to fully customise and get the website to look, feel and behave the way I wanted and had designed it too. I did my programming in HTML and CSS, using Brackets (a simple web development app for Mac) To make the website responsive, I used Media Queries to make text and elements scale automatically to fit the screen size of the device you’re browsing the website on.</p>

    </div>
     <h3 class="project-heading-h3">Responsive</h3>
         <p id="p-project-text-left">It was important for me that the website looks good both on small screens, like smartphones, and bigger screens like desktop computer screens (and on tablets as well). So during the design process I always think mobile first, since it’s always easier to scale up a website and make it look presentable than the other way around. This resulted in a design that displays text and images in columns on bigger screens (to take advantage of the width of big screens), but when viewed on a smaller screen the images and text automatically order themselves in a more vertical way. If you’re on a desktop or laptop computer right now, try and resize the browser window to see how the content automatically adjusts.

        <h2 class="project-heading-h2">Accessibility Considerations</h2>  
   <p id="p-project-text-left">Accessibility on the web is something that I prioritize when I design my solutions. I believe that the web should be accessible to all, and it’s a shame that it’s not, especially since there are no limitations on the web, we have the technology to make it all accessible! The issue is not the technology, but the lack of knowledge about the importance and how to make the web accessible. That is why I recently got a certification in -link with title- Accessibility on the web. And I’m a member of -link with title- t12t (A Swedish organisation dedicated to inform and inspire people about digital accessibility).

        <p id="p-project-text-left">I aimed to make my portfolio accessible to all, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Some examples are:
